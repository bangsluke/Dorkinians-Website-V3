## Environment Configuration
- Always confirm user's preferred environment file structure before implementation
- Prefer single `.env` files with environment-specific prefixes (e.g., `DEV_`, `PROD_`) when user specifies this preference
- Avoid assumptions about `.env.local` vs `.env` approaches without user confirmation
- After asking once, assume that an `.env` file exists and only mention it when new values need to be added to it

## Progressive Development
- Start with simplest possible solutions and add complexity only after basic functionality is verified
- Test environment configuration before implementing complex features
- Create minimal test scripts first, then enhance with advanced functionality
- **External Data Validation**: Always verify external data source accessibility (URLs, APIs, files) before implementing data processing logic
- **Progressive Debugging**: Start with simplest possible tests (URL accessibility, basic connectivity) before complex operations
- **Data Source Testing**: Test data sources at the HTTP level before implementing parsing and processing logic
- **Progressive Complexity Development**: Start with the simplest working solution, then enhance incrementally. Avoid over-engineering before basic functionality is proven
- **Environment Isolation Testing**: Test each environment independently before assuming cross-compatibility. Validate credentials, connections, and data flow separately
- **File State Verification**: Read files before and after modifications to ensure changes are applied correctly
- **Documentation Synchronization**: Update all related documentation files when making architectural changes

## Module Compatibility
- Verify import/export compatibility between TypeScript and CommonJS before creating test scripts
- Use appropriate tools for the task - avoid `ts-node` for simple environment checks when `node` suffices
- Ensure test scripts can run without complex module resolution issues

## Platform Compatibility
- **Platform Agnostic Operations**: Consider Windows vs Unix command differences in all terminal operations
- Use cross-platform compatible approaches when possible (e.g., PowerShell-compatible commands on Windows)
- Test commands on the target platform before assuming universal compatibility
- **Tool Command Precision**: Always verify command syntax before execution, especially in different shell environments
- **Command Fallback**: Use fallback methods when primary tools fail or encounter errors

## User Preference Discovery
- Proactively discover user preferences rather than making assumptions about configuration approaches
- Ask clarifying questions early in the process to avoid wasted effort
- Adapt implementation strategy based on user feedback and preferences

## Tool Reliability & Fallbacks
- **Search Tool Limitations**: When search_replace fails, use read_file to understand context and apply changes manually
- **File Reading Dependency**: Read files multiple times if necessary to understand current state before making changes
- **Tool Error Handling**: Always have a fallback approach when automated tools encounter issues
- **Verification Protocol**: Verify all changes were applied correctly before proceeding to next steps
