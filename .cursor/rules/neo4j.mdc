## Graph Data Safety
- When adding any nodes to the Neo4j graph, ensure the nodes have a property called "graphLabel" with the value "dorkiniansWebsite"
- When clearing the graph, only delete nodes that have the property "graphLabel" with the value "dorkiniansWebsite"
- Always use the `clearGraphData()` method which includes pre-deletion safety checks and logging
- Implement safe deletion methods that verify `graphLabel` before any destructive operations

## Database Operations
- Use the `createNode()` helper method which automatically adds `graphLabel` and `createdAt` properties
- Use the `createRelationship()` helper method which ensures both nodes have the correct `graphLabel`
- Query nodes using `getNodesByGraphLabel()` to ensure data isolation between projects
- Use `getDatabaseStats()` to monitor only `dorkiniansWebsite` labeled data
- **CSV Data Validation**: Verify Google Sheets CSV URLs are accessible (return 200 status) before implementing seeding logic
- **Local Development Support**: Support both local Neo4j Desktop and production Aura environments with proper configuration
- **Data Source Testing**: Test CSV URL accessibility with simple HTTP requests before complex data processing

## External Data Integration
- **External Data Source Validation**: Always verify external data sources (CSVs, APIs) before building complex processing logic
- Test CSV URLs, API endpoints, and data formats in isolation first
- Validate data structure and accessibility before implementing parsing and seeding logic
- Have fallback strategies (e.g., sample data) when external sources are temporarily unavailable

## Schema Design Principles
- **Schema Simplicity First**: Prefer simple string properties over complex node types unless complex relationships provide clear analytical value
- **Constraint Validation**: Only create unique constraints for fields that truly need to be unique across all records
- **User Intent Alignment**: Validate schema design assumptions against user requirements before implementation
- **Performance vs. Complexity**: Complex graph relationships should only be created when they provide clear analytical value

## Environment Management
- **Environment Isolation Testing**: Test each Neo4j environment independently before assuming cross-compatibility
- Validate production vs development credentials, connections, and data flow separately
- Use environment-specific seeding scripts to avoid credential confusion
- Test connection and basic operations before attempting complex data operations
