## Graph Data Safety
- When adding any nodes to the Neo4j graph, ensure the nodes have a property called "graphLabel" with the value "dorkiniansWebsite"
- When clearing the graph, only delete nodes that have the property "graphLabel" with the value "dorkiniansWebsite"
- Always use the `clearGraphData()` method which includes pre-deletion safety checks and logging
- Implement safe deletion methods that verify `graphLabel` before any destructive operations

## Database Operations
- Use the `createNode()` helper method which automatically adds `graphLabel` and `createdAt` properties
- Use the `createRelationship()` helper method which ensures both nodes have the correct `graphLabel`
- Query nodes using `getNodesByGraphLabel()` to ensure data isolation between projects
- Use `getDatabaseStats()` to monitor only `dorkiniansWebsite` labeled data
